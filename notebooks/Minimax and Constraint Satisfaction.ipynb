But map coloring is just an example of determining the _chromatic number_ ([Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring#Chromatic_number)) of a graph - the smallest number of colors needed to color it so that adjacent nodes don't share a color. A _loopless planar graph_ (e.g., a map) has a maximum chromatic number of 4 (which is needed for the US map - look at the pointy bit of Nevada), but may be lower (Australia is 3).  The theory and practice of coloring general graphs has been a topic of some interest to theoretical CS people for decades and mathematicians for centuries.\n",
